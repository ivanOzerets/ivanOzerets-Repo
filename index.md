Hello,

My name is Ivan Ozerets. I am 21 and am interested in learning all about machine learning. I grew up in Southern California and have lived here my whole life. My parents both immigrated from Russia just before I was born and gave me one of the greatest gifts a partent can give: a second langueage. That language being Russian obviously. 

I am decently proficient in the following programming languages:
    - C++
    - Java
    - ARM Assembly

*Trying to get into python on my own time recently*
